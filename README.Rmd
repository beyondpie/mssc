# MSSC: Multiple-subject differential analysis for single-cell RNA sequencing data

The goal of mssc is to provide a tool for differential analysis for
single-cell RNA sequencing data by considering the batch effects
induced when multiple subjects under different conditions, which is
ignored by pseudo-bulk analysis and cannot be handled well by simple
generalized linear models.

## Installation

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("beyondpie/mssc")
