# MSSC: Multiple-subject differential analysis for single-cell RNA sequencing data

The goal of mssc is to provide a tool for differential analysis for
single-cell RNA sequencing data by considering the batch effects
induced when multiple subjects under different conditions, which is
ignored by pseudo-bulk analysis and cannot be handled well by simple
generalized linear models.

## Installation

``` r
## install cmdstanr firslty.
## directly use install.package("cmdstanr") may face error.
install.packages("cmdstanr",
                 repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
## then install mssc
if(!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("beyondpie/mssc")
## mssc => cmdstanr => cmdstan  (=>: depends on)
## so we also need to install cmdstan, which is not an R packge, but cmdline Stan tool.
## Prefer to use cmdstanr to install it since cmdstanr will then remember where the cmdstan is,
## otherwise you have to install cmdstan independently and tell cmdstanr where it is by call
## `cmdstanr::set_cmdstan_path()`.
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

## Test
The test script can be download here: 
https://github.com/beyondpie/mssc/blob/main/inst/rscript/test.R.
You can also use the command line below to find the script.
```r
## test.R script can be got from the package.
test_script = system.file("rscript", "test.R", package = "mssc", mustWork = TRUE)
```
Then you can run this script to test if you can run mssc without errors.
